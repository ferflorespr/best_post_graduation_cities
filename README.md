# 🗺️ U.S. Software Engineer Salary & Cost of Living Visualizer

This project provides interactive visualizations to help software engineers compare U.S. cities and states based on:

- ✅ **Adjusted Software Engineer Salaries**
- ✅ **Cost of Living and Rent Data**
- ✅ **State Income Tax Rates (2025)**
